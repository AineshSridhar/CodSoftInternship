Tkinter Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed using the Tkinter library. Each project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application demonstrating different functionalities like a calculator, password generator, and to-do list manager.

Repository Structure
1. CalculatorTk.py
This is a fully functional calculator built using Tkinter. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with a user-friendly GUI.

2. Password_Gen.py
A password generator tool that creates strong, random passwords. Users can select the length of the password, and the program provides options for including letters, numbers, and special characters.

3. ToDoList.py
A to-do list manager that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The simple interface helps users organize and manage daily tasks efficiently.

How to Run the Applications
Install Tkinter: Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, but if you need to install it, you can do so with the following command:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
On Windows, Tkinter should be included in your Python installation by default.

Run the Python Script: You can run any of the .py files directly using Python:
python CalculatorTk.py
python Password_Gen.py
python ToDoList.py
This will launch the respective GUI application.
